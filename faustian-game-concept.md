# FAUSTIAN
### Game Concept Summary

**Faustian** is a roguelike deckbuilding game where players make unholy bargains with demons, signing contracts for power while managing the consequences. Set across the nine circles of Hell, players must generate enough unholy wealth to satisfy increasingly demanding demonic contracts.

## Core Gameplay

Players use a unique deck of 91 cards (13 values across 7 deadly sin categories) to generate resources through strategic card combinations. Each level requires meeting a specific wealth threshold to progress.

- **Card Play**: Up to 7 cards can be played at once, allowing for unique combinations
- **Resource System**: Spend blood to play cards that generate infernal gold
- **Contract Signing**: Gain powerful abilities with lasting negative consequences
- **Corruption Management**: Balance power gains against increasing penalties

## Unique Features

1. **Blood-to-Gold Economy**: Convert your vital essence into cursed wealth to satisfy demonic pacts
   
2. **Sin Affinity System**: Cards belong to the 7 deadly sins, with special bonuses for sin-based combinations

3. **Sacrifice Mechanics**: Discard cards for blood resources, making tough choices about what to keep

4. **Soul Debt System**: Debt increases with inefficient play (unused cards or excessive plays), adding pressure to be strategic

5. **Critical Hand Challenges**: Each level presents a specific card combination that grants massive bonuses if achieved

6. **Contract Signing**: Sign permanent contracts for immediate benefits and lasting consequences

7. **Card Modification Tools**: Customize your deck by changing card values, sin types, and special effects

## Game Structure

- **9 Circles of Hell**: Each circle introduces new mechanics and challenges
- **3 Levels Per Circle**: 2 standard levels followed by a boss encounter
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Deeper circles require more wealth with harsher penalties
- **Meta Progression**: Unlock new cards, tools, and starting options between runs

## Strategic Depth

- **Deck Building**: Craft a focused strategy around specific sin combinations
- **Resource Management**: Balance blood expenditure against gold generation
- **Contract Decisions**: Choose which permanent contracts to sign and when
- **Hand Optimization**: Maximize value from limited card plays
- **Risk vs. Reward**: Higher corruption offers more power but greater consequences

## Aesthetic Direction

- **Demonic Visuals**: DOOM-inspired hellscapes with gore, fire, and brimstone
- **Occult Symbolism**: Pentagrams, runes, and demonic sigils throughout UI and cards
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Cards and environments evolve as corruption increases

This roguelike experience combines strategic depth with thematic richness, creating a game where every decision feels like another step in your pact with darkness. Will you master the art of infernal contracts, or be consumed by the very power you sought to control?
